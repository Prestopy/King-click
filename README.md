# Presto.py (aka King-click)
Hello people of the world! You might know me as Presto.py, Presto Pie, King Click, or many other things, but for those who don't know me, I am a human being. I know right! What a surprise!
Jokes aside, I love programming, debating, writing, and of course, reading. They are the things that make my life interesting, and I'm not sure if I can live without them.

This was an abandoned discord bot project ðŸ˜­. To be honest, it was almost finished. However, my team ran into some issues and just lost the momentum in general. May you rest in peace, Uxtron.
